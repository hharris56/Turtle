Day 1 - 5/27/2020

Fresh off of a semester at DVC filled with ups and downs due to 
the coronavirus. I am interested in starting this new project to 
try and create a personalized terminal shell that is executable 
and downloadable. If it is able to work well my friend and I will 
hopefully continue work on it. 

Today we completed the basic user input and output commands as 
well as the skeleton for a shell function. The program is going 
to be written in python. Hunter is very good at Python so he is 
leading the way in that aspect. We completed the gitignore and 
git files as well as figured out how to transfer files through 
git push commands. It is all going well so far with our aim to 
introduce some basic commands like:

cd	mkdir	rm	ls	la(ls -A)	

With Hunter completing work on the basic skeleton tonight, next 
time we resume work we will be focusing on introducing the most 
basic of commands to the line then moving onto how we are going 
to operate in a seperate window.
