Hey Visitors,

project initated on 5/27/2020

We are attempting to construct a shell nicknamed turtle shell or tshell

This shell will help us exemplify what we know and add do our understanding 
of the command line

Please Enjoy looking around at our progress. I will update the readme with 
comments as we proceed further into the project. 

Using https://danishpraka.sh/2018/09/27/shell-in-python.html as a rough guide
